        <h1>About the Maza Hive Mining</h1>
        
        
        <p>
            Hive mining allows any Maza holder to try and mine blocks 
and secure the blockchain, without needing any special hardware and at 
extremely low energy cost.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
            From the Hive tab in the core wallet, you can spend Maza to 
create worker bees -- mining agents which live inside the blockchain and
 work to extend the chain while earning block rewards for you, the Maza 
beekeeper.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Bee creation form</h4>
        <p>
            The bee cost is calculated as a percentage of current block reward, and will only change at reward halvening.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can create as many bees at once as you like, but note that funds spent to create bees are lost forever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before creating bees, you should check the indicated Global Index is less than 100, to ensure likely profitability; <a href="https://hive.mazacoin.org/gi/">see here</a> for more information about the Global Index.
        </p>
        
        <h4>What happens when you create bees?</h4>
        <p>
           Maza spent creating bees is destroyed - it's literally lost 
forever. Bee creation fees are not sent to the dev team, or anyone else.
 However, you can optionally choose to instead donate 15% of the bee 
creation cost to a community fund which helps fund further development. 
This is completely optional and makes no difference to the total cost 
you pay or the number of bees you get.
        </p>
        
        <p>
           Once you've created your bees and the creation transaction 
has appeared in a block, your bees will be displayed in the "Your Hive" 
section of the Hive tab.
        </p>
        
        <h4>What happens after the bees are created?</h4>
        <p>
           After creation, bees take 720 blocks to mature (approximately
 12 hours of chain time). During this time, your wallet does not need to
 be online; the bees will mature regardless.
        </p>
        <p>
           After the maturation period, bees live for 10,080 blocks 
(approximately 7 days). During this time, your wallet should remain 
online as much as possible; your bees can only work for you while your 
wallet is connected to the network.
        </p>
        <p>
           While your bees are alive and your wallet is online, your 
bees will attempt to produce a new hivemined block every time they 
observe a new incoming proof-of-work block; hivemined blocks must always
 follow proof-of-work blocks. This mining attempt takes only a fraction 
of a second even for large hives, and shouldn't cause any lag or lock-up
 of your computer. Energy usage is negligible.
        </p>
        <p>
           If your bees manage to successfully mine a block, your wallet
 will receive the block rewards (as well as any transaction fees in the 
block) just as if you were a proof-of-work miner.
        </p>
        <p>
           Network hive difficulty automatically adjusts to the current 
bee population so that generally, only one bee in the whole network will
 succeed at hivemining a given block. However, orphan blocks do occur if
 more than one bee succeeds in mining a block at the same height. They 
are expected, and are nothing to worry about. In the case of your bees 
managing to mine a block but another bee managing to as well, you may 
see "Generated but not accepted" block rewards shown in the Transactions
 tab. Note that only confirmed block rewards are shown on the Hive tab; 
rewards will never disappear after being shown there.
        </p>
        <p>
           On the Transactions tab, the highlighted block is an orphan; the one below it is fine.
        </p>
        
        
        <h4>Hive weight</h4>
        <p>
        
           On the Hive tab, a widget at the bottom-left displays your 
hive weight. This fraction represents the amount of the current bee 
population that you control. For example, if you have 1000 bees and 
there are 10000 bees in total alive across the network, your hive weight
 will be 0.100, indicating you control 10% of the network. As well as a 
measure of your share of the network, this fraction is also the 
probability that your hive will be able to solve any given 
hivemine-eligible block.
        
        </p><h4>What happens if my wallet is offline/computer is down?</h4>
        <p></p>
        <p></p><h5>
           Note that if your wallet is offline during the working 
lifespan of your bees, they will be unable to attempt to mine blocks, 
but their lifespan will still decrease as other miners extend the 
blockchain.
            </h5>
        <p></p>
        <p>
           At the very bottom-right of the wallet, a hexagonal Hive 
status icon (second from right) indicates that your bees are mature and 
working by showing green. For any other colour, please mouseover the 
icon for additional info.
        </p>
