# Download MAZA Software

MAZA 0.16.3 was released on January 13th, 2022  
We are very excited about this new release! You will be able to hive-mine from within the wallet.  Don't know what that means?  We will put out a hive mining guide before the hive mining takes effect later in February.
MAZA will hard fork sometime in February, so your old software will be obsolete!
UPDATE TODAY

## Downloads are available via GitHub for
 * Linux
 * OSX 
 * Windows

### So, which files to get? How does this work?

Get all the MAZA_v0.16.3- files for your operating system by clicking on them and saving them to your computer.
 
For example, most windows users would get the 3 files that have win64 in them (win 32 for older machines).  Once they are on your machine double click on the one that says setup and ends in .exe.  This will cause the installer to run and you can just follow the directions to install it.
