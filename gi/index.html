        <h3>
        <p>
            Because the potential Maza hive mining block rewards 
available to the entire network over a given time period are fixed, 
there is a maximum bee population that can be sustained by the network 
while still expecting all bees to be profitable (ie, to return more 
block rewards than the cost of the bees).
        </p>
        
    
        <p>
            The Global Index gives Maza beekeepers a simple way to make a value judgement call before creating bees.
        </p>
        

        <p>
            When the Global Index is below 100 (green is still visible 
in the GI pie chart), all live bees are expected to be profitable and 
make you Maza!
        </p>
        
      
        <p>
            When the Global Index is equal to or greater than 100 (only 
red is visible in the GI pie chart), there are more bees than can be 
expected to be profitable, and it may be wise to wait for the population
 to decrease before creating bees.
        </p>
